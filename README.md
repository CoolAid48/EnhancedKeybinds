# CoolAid's Enhanced Keybinds

## This mod is still marked as beta because I haven't been able to fully test anything. Please report bugs (and suggestions) [over on GitHub](https://github.com/CoolAid48/EnhancedKeybinds/issues)

#### Enhanced Keybinds allows you to assign a modifier key (alt, ctrl, shift) + another key to any vanilla keybind!

This mod also adds new vanilla keybinds, such as those from the options menu:

- `"Sneaking Mode"` Hotkey

- `"Sprinting Mode"` Hotkey

- `"Toggle Subtitles"` Hotkey

- `"Toggle Auto-Jump"` Hotkey

All keybinds are `unbound` by default, and you can completely disable these additional keybinds in the mod's config settings.

- Compatible with ANY other mods that add to the vanilla keybinds system!
- Compatible with [Controlling](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlling)
- Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)


#### Heavily inspired by mikhailtapio's [Modern KeyBinding](https://modrinth.com/mod/modernkeybinding) mod
