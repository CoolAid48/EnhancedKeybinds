# CoolAid's Enhanced Keybinds

### Enhanced Keybinds allows you to assign a modifier key (alt, ctrl, shift, win) + another key on the keyboard to any vanilla keybind! This mod is a fork of Amecs and now works on versions 1.21.5+

## This mod adds:
- **Modifier Keys** (alt, ctrl, shift, win) which can be added with another key for more binds
- **New Vanilla Keybinds**, such as the toggle-able settings from the options menu, toggleable skin layer keybinds, and an alternate esc key bind! All keybinds are `unbound` by default, and you also have the option to remove the new keybinds entirely in the config (restart required)
- **Compatibility** with [Controlling](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlling) and ANY other mods that add to the vanilla keybinds system!

#### Enhanced Keybinds requires ONLY the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and is a fork of MisterCheezeCake's [Amecs Reborn](https://modrinth.com/mod/amecs-reborn)
