# CoolAid's Enhanced Keybinds

### Enhanced Keybinds allows you to assign a modifier key (alt, ctrl, shift) + another key to any vanilla keybind!

## This mod also adds:
- **Disable Key Conflicts**, allowing all hotkeys with the same keybind to activate when pressed (restart required)
- **New Vanilla Keybinds**, such as the toggle-able settings from the options menu! All keybinds are `unbound` by default, 
and you also have the option to remove the new keybinds entirely in the config (restart required)
- **Compatibility** with ANY other mods that add to the vanilla keybinds system!
- **Compatibility** with [Controlling](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlling)

#### Enhanced Keybinds requires ONLY the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and is heavily inspired by mikhailtapio's [Modern KeyBinding](https://modrinth.com/mod/modernkeybinding) mod
